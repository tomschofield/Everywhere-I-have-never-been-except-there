# Everywhere-I-have-never-been-except-there
Everywhere I have never been, except there uses a crowdsourced database of WiFi network names and their locations to combine, contort and degrade spaces connected by coincidence. The work examines signals from nearby smartphones probing them for their own spatial histories, told through records of past networks they have connected to. Instead of using this information as the basis of security attacks the work uses the resulting network of global locations to imagine new hybrid spaces brought together by shared network names. Map tiles from areas sharing WiFi network names are blended, so that features of satellites imagery generate digital artefacts: glitches; rhythms; and textures. Asymmetries of power produced by collaboratively produced databases, by cyber attacks, and by the skills held by individuals to operationalise them are sidelined in the pursuit of chance, of speculation and of new imaginary landscapes.
